Release Notes for TYPO3 CMS 6.2.31
==================================

This document contains information about TYPO3 CMS 6.2.31 which was
released on April 18th, 2017.

News
----

This version is a maintenance release and contains bug fixes only.

**This is the last regular maintenance of TYPO3 6.2 supported by the
TYPO3 Core Team - version 6.2.31 marks end of life for TYPO3 CMS 6.2
LTS.**

If you are running TYPO3 CMS 6.2 and are not able to update to TYPO3 v7
or v8 (yet), we’d like to point you to a special “[Extended
LTS](https://typo3.com/our-services/extended-support/)” service provided
by TYPO3 GmbH. Like already provided for version 4.5, it is possible to
get further support for the TYPO3 6.2 core for up to two years.

Upgrading
---------

The [usual upgrading
procedure](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/InstallationGuide/) applies.
No database updates are necessary.\
It might be required to clear all caches; the “important actions”
section in the TYPO3 Install Tool offers the accordant possibility to do
so.
