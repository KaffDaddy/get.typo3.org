Upgrading
---------

The [usual upgrading
procedure](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/InstallationGuide/) applies.
No database updates are necessary.

Breaking Change
---------------

With the newly released TYPO3 versions, the description field of the
filelink content element is HTML encoded by default. If you allowed
editors to enter HTML code in this field, you may want to add the
following line to your TypoScript template, before updating.

    tt_content.uploads.20.itemRendering.20.2.htmlSpecialChars = 0

Allowing HTML in this field is discouraged for editors, same as allowing
the plain HTML content.
