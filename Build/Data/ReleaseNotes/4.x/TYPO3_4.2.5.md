Upgrading
---------

If you have used TYPO3 4.2.4 before and have already created a new
encryption-key with TYPO3 4.2.4, you don't have to do anything special.
Just do the update as usual.

If you have not: You will need to create a **new encryption key**! See
[TYPO3 Security
Bulletin](https://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-sa-2009-001/),
section “Vulnerable subcomponent \#1” for instructions.

Again, if you have not already followed the instructions found in the
4.2.4 Release Notes, **please read the following carefully**:

If you use Firefox 3 or Epiphany 2 you have to be careful:

Clear the configuration cache **before** you start with the update (if
you don't you can still physically delete the
*typo3conf/temp\_CACHED\_\** files). And you must delete the cookies of
the TYPO3 BE in your browsers. Otherwise you won't be able to login into
the backend any more, because you get logged out by a timeout
immediately. You must not only delete the cookies for your specific
domain (say www.domain.com), but also the “wildcard” cookies (e.g.
“.domain.com” or “\*.domain.com”).

Database-updates are not necessary.
