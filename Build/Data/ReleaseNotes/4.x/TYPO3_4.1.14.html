    * Fixed bug #13959: Security precaution for extensions which use their own autoloader. Note: This is the same fix which has been committed to TYPO3 4.3 where it is marked as a security fix. However, versions prior to TYPO3 4.3 do not ship with an autoloader, so they are not affected by this problem unless an extension provides its own autoloader.
