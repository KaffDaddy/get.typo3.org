Upgrading
---------

The [usual upgrading
procedure](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/InstallationGuide/) applies.

Please note: A minor database schema update was included in this release
in order to fix issue <issue>16762</issue>. This is unusual for a patch
level release, but we decided to include it anyway with the following
rationale:

-   New installations get the correct field definition from start (bug
    fixed).
-   Old installations updating to the newest patch level by simply
    updading the TYPO3 Sources (usual procedure): No change of
    functionality, nothing breaks. But the bug won't be fixed.
-   Old installations which need this bug fixed need to apply the TYPO3
    Source Upgrade and do an one time “Database Compare” in the Install
    Tool afterwards.

So the last step is optional and only required if you are really hit by
this bug and want to have it solved in your existing installation. Most
integrations won't be affected by this bug anyway.
