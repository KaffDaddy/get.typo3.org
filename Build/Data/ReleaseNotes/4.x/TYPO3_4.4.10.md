Notes
-----

This release aims to fix two regressions that have been introduced with
the provious releases at end of July 2011:

-   [\#28536](https://forge.typo3.org/issues/28536): The JavaScript
    command of popup windows in the frontend has been encoded twice.
-   [\#28847](https://forge.typo3.org/issues/28847): The fontTag
    security fix lead to a breaking change, if the default TypoScript
    for lib.stdheader has been modified. A compatibility fix has been
    integrated to have a secure fallback, if the fontTag property was
    customized (see [this blog
    article](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/breaking-changes-in-the-latest-typo3-security-release/)
    to get more information).
