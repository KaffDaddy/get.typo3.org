<h1 id="release-notes-for-typo3-4.0">RELEASE NOTES FOR TYPO3 4.0</h1>
<p>This page contains all important 4.0 specific information. (See also: <a href="Upgrade" title="wikilink">Upgrade guide</a>)</p>
<h2 id="symlink-change">Symlink Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Starting with TYPO3 4.0beta3, internal symlinks are not used anymore. This means, that there will be no symlinks inside the <code>typo3_src/</code> folder. However, some extensions are not correctly adopted to the new scheme, therefore, you may want to add the symlinks again to prevent any problems.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If you are upgrading from an older version, you will need to change the symlink <code>index.php</code> (pointing to <code>tslib/index_ts.php</code> in TYPO3_3.8.1 and before) to point to <code>typo3_src/index.php</code> in TYPO3 4.0:</li>
</ul>
<p><shell> rm index.php ln -s typo3_src/index.php index.php</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>(provided you have linked the “typo3_src” folder to your TYPO3 source folder, e.g. “typo3_src-4.0/”)</li>
</ol>
<p></shell></p>
<ul>
<li>Please keep in mind that there will be no symlinks anymore from the provided fonts <code>nimbus.ttf</code> and <code>vera.ttf</code> to <code>arial.ttf</code> and <code>verdana.ttf</code>. If you depend on these fonts, you need to upload the original fonts manually or create symlinks to these look-alike-fonts in <code>t3lib/fonts/</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2>
<p>As with any TYPO3 release, the default extension set has been changed. There are some new <strong>system extensions</strong> that were distributed as default <strong>global extensions</strong> in 3.8.x, as well as some new system extensions that were previously only available through the . There are some extensions that are no longer shipped with the TYPO3 source and are available through TER.</p>
<p>Because <strong>local extensions</strong> (typo3conf/ext) take precedence in loading over global ones (typo3/ext), and global extensions over system ones (typo3/sysext), make sure you are not overriding newer system or global extensions with older ones installed as locals. When you remove extensions from typo3conf/ext/ or typo3/ext/ because they are now a system extension (rtehtmlarea for example), don't forget to remove the temp_CACHED_* files in typo3conf/ <strong>manually</strong>.</p>
<p>Only the security checked extensions can be seen with the Extension Manager (EM). If you want to see all extensions, then you must activate them manually in the EM settings section. Click the checkbox 'enable unsupported extensions'. In the 'import extensions' menu you must click on 'Retrieve/Update' to get the latest list of available extensions from TER.</p>
<h4 id="new-system-extensions">New System Extensions</h4>
<p>The following extensions were previously only available through TER and are shipped as system extensions in TYPO3 4.0:</p>
<ul>

<li>tstemplate_info</li>
<li>tstemplate_objbrowser</li>

<h2 id="localizationlanguage-packs">Localization/Language packs</h2>
<ul>
<li>The old csh_[lang-key] extensions are not used anymore.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Please go to the EM and use the new function “Translation handling”. There you just select all languages you want to to carry within your installation.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>For one-time initial update or later synchronisation you need to use the button “Update from repository”.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>On installing additional extensions later on the EM automatically takes care to import the appropriate language-packs as selected (only if available of course)! You only need to use the “Translation handling” if you want to update/check lables with the translation-server</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="important-utf-8-database-settings-change">Important UTF-8 database settings change</h2>
<p>For using TYPO3 version 4.0, on a MySQL-4.1 (maybe other versions) with a UTF-8 based database, please refer to the details of <a href="https://forge.typo3.org/issues/14848" class="uri">https://forge.typo3.org/issues/14848</a>.</p>
<h2 id="direct-mail-extension">Direct Mail Extension</h2>
<p>Old versions of direct mail don't work anymore with TYPO3 4.0, so you need to get the latest version from the Extension Repository.</p>
<h2 id="rich-text-editor">Rich Text Editor</h2>
<p>TYPO3 4.0 ships with rtehtmlarea as the default RTE. You can install it using the Extension Manager. (If you have an old version of rtehtmlarea in typo3conf/ext/, you must delete it.)</p>
<h2 id="new-skin">New Skin</h2>
<p>TYPO3 Version 4.0 is shipped with a new default skin developed by Thomas Murphy and the design team. It is enabled by default. If you would like to switch back to the original skin you can just do so by uninstalling the extension “t3skin” in the Extension Manager.</p>
<h2 id="quickstart-and-testsite-packages">Quickstart and Testsite packages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Notice that the “Quickstart” and the “Testsite” packages are no longer provided. Instead, you can get them as a T3D file which can be imported using the Import/Export extension. See <a href="https://typo3.org/download/" class="uri">https://typo3.org/download/</a> for details.</li>
</ul>

    * Release of TYPO3 4.0

2006-04-06  Michael Stucki  michael@typo3.org

    *&amp;nbsp;!!! Fixed bug #3151: $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[im_jpg_quality] was changed to $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[jpg_quality] some time ago except in one place. Three questions marks since this was changed some time ago but not mentioned in here.
    *&amp;nbsp;!!! Remove hardcoded linebreak after radio elements. Notice that this will affect your template when in &quot;accessibility&quot; mode with $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[SYS][compat_version] lower than 4.0.

2006-04-04  Michael Stucki  michael@typo3.org

    * Release of TYPO3 4.0rc3
    * Fixed bug #3065: wrap2.splitChar and wrap3.splitChar are ignored
    * Fix RDCT links: Did not point to index.php by default
    * Fix several bugs related with CSS Styled Content, see below. Many thanks to Ernesto Baschny who did all of this!
        * Now the CSS version of &quot;Text w/images&quot; and &quot;Images&quot; (table-less) also respect the textMargin constant so that (finally) the user can specify a different margin to separate the image block from the text. &quot;colSpacing&quot; now only applies to inter-images spacing, which is what the table-based approach also does.
        * For this to work we need to apply two new classes to the images (csc-textpic-firstcol and csc-textpic-lastcol). This is configurable through an optionSplitted new property &quot;addClassesImage&quot; of the USER object
        * Having this also allowed us to fix a bug in positioning: The whole image-block can now stretch correctly over the given width without any margins around it (which is required if you have just an image-block, without text). Without the patch, you always have &quot;margin-right&quot; (if images are placed to the left or center) or &quot;margin-right&quot; (if images are placed to the right).
        * Fixed also a problem with the calculation of image width if we have borders and border-spacings: Now the whole image-block will always be exactly maxW wide (so if you have borders and spacing, the images will get slightly smaller). Without this, the image-block could &quot;explode&quot; a fixed-width layout.
        * Added empty rendering definition for cType &quot;div&quot;  (divider) to prevent error message
    * Fixed setup module: Colons were wrapped to the next line
    * Small fixes to t3skin
    * Indexed Search: Added crawler support for $GLOBALS[T3_VAR][ext][indexed_search][indexLocalFiles]

    * Fixed bug in T3D export where an array key prevented references in flexform fields to be correctly remapped. My mistake from cleaning up t3lib_flexformtools.

    * Fix bugtracker issue 2958: t3lib_htmlmail::getMimeType isn&#39;t working with name based virtual hosts

2006-03-22  Kasper Skaarhoj  kasperYYYY@typo3.com

    * Also added check for extension dependencies in Import/Export: It is not possible to import a T3D file unless extension dependencies are OK. This still needs more work and connection to EM.

2006-03-15  Kasper Skaarhoj  kasperYYYY@typo3.com

    *&amp;nbsp;!!! Implemented complete &quot;flavouring&quot; of FlexForm XML; Basically it doesn&#39;t affect anyone using xml2array() to extract FlexForm data but everyone who uses own XML parsers will have to modify them (after converting all XML). Basically the flavouring means that a tag like &quot;lDEF, lDA&quot; is rather represented with &quot;language index=&quot;lDEF&quot;, language index=&quot;lDA&quot;&quot;.
    *&amp;nbsp;!!! Cleaned up t3lib_flexformtools::traverseFlexFormXMLData() and related functions, generally I did many changes to this class. However I think no one is using it yet except me. Anyway, the changes were necessary since it was simply never cleaned up as it should have been, including the new cleanFlexFormXML() function.
    * Bigfix: Modified sys_refindex so it does not register references for content in flexforms outside what the data structure describes. Update your reference table again!
    * Added configuration option TYPO3_CONF_VARS[BE][niceFlexFormXMLtags] which allows people who depends on the old FlexForm tags to maintain that compliancy. See my changelog from 2006-01-27 (sorry for this semi-feature).

    * Changed formURL in fe_adminLib.inc to always contain a question mark &quot;?&quot; because in the templates the formurl marker is used like ###FORM_URL###&amp;cmd=edit which didn&#39;t work if the URL didn&#39;t contain a question mark like in simulStatic- or RealURLs. This fixes typo3.org bug #2563.

2006-02-23  Stanislas Rolland  stanislas.rolland@fructifor.ca

    * Remove RTE-enabling defaultExtras off tt_content bodytext (related to bug #2023).
    * Fix bugtracker issue 2656 in htmlArea RTE.

2006-02-23  Rene Fritz  r.fritz@colorcube.de

    * Fixed bug #2662: added check against &quot;Limit to languages&quot;

2006-02-23  Kasper Skaarhoj  kasperYYYY@typo3.com

    * Changed things related to locallang-XML handling. Most significantly is it that translations are looked for in the new language pack directories typo3conf/l10n/[langyage key]/.
    * All locallang-XML files are updated to have ONLY the default labels in them and no specific references to external files; means translations will work only with language packs installed in typo3conf/l10n/. Such language packs will be distributed as zip-files around the release.
    * csh_* extensions (language pack extensions) are now obsolete.

2006-02-22  Dmitry Dulepov  typo3@accio.lv

    * t3libBEfunc::thumbCode() did not make proper image path under certain conditions
    * Fixed bug #2654: Incorrect conversion of non-ascii (Latvian) characters in URL

2006-02-22  Wolfgang Klinger  wk@plan2.net

    * Fixed bug #1596: checkIncludeLines uses preg_match now and checks for all whitespace before and after INCLUDE_TYPOSCRIPT
    * Fixed bug #2592: Page type &quot;External URL&quot; and &quot;Shortcut&quot; causes an error (jumpUrlX methods)

2006-02-22  Kasper Skaarhoj  kasperYYYY@typo3.com

    * Added 3 languages: Faroe, Serbian, Farsi
    * Fixed bug in t3lib_div::cHashParams()
    * Brought back support in EM&#39;s index.php::importExtFromRep() function for direct injection of an array with extension files (needed for support for kickstarter, but new function parameters are kept)
    * Added new Indexing Configuration for indexed search: Traversal of page tree. Means that now the page tree can be indexed by the &quot;crawler&quot; extension (cronscript)
    * Added meta indexing configuration type (useful for group-categorizing of search results)
    * Added a condition to indexing of pages; that sys_language_uid and sys_language_content must be similar; it is assumed that for pages with fallback to default content no indexing is wanted.
    * Added &quot;Spotlight&quot; categorizing feature to search results. The categories are defined as indexing configurations + natural categories like pages in the page tree. TypoScript configuration applies.

2006-02-21  Karsten Dambekalns  karsten@typo3.org

    * typo3/stylesheet.css: Fix for trivial bug #2644, added sans-serif as fallback font-family.

2006-02-21  Stanislas Rolland  stanislas.rolland@fructifor.ca

2006-02-18  Robert Lemke  robert@typo3.org

    * Changed flexform tag names in t3lib_flexformtools-flex2ArrayXml()

2006-02-17  Karsten Dambekalns  karsten@typo3.org

    * Fixed bugs #2368, #2521, #2385, #2186 related to DBAL

2006-02-17  Michael Stucki  michael@typo3.org

    * Fixed bug #2597: GDlib TrueType tests fail because of wrong fontFile-path (caused by the symlinks change)
    * Fixed bug #2594: Install Tool says &quot;No gfx/typo3logo.gif file!&quot; (caused by the symlinks change)

2006-02-17  Ingmar Schlecht  ingmar@typo3.org

    * Fixed obvious bug #2588 in right-click context menu of filelist navframe

2006-02-17  Stanislas Rolland  stanislas.rolland@fructifor.ca

    * Updated the copyright notices to 2006 and set version back to 4.0-CVS

2006-02-16  Kasper Skaarhoj  kasperYYYY@typo3.com

    * Added new script (tslib/class.tslib_eidtools.php) with tools for &quot;eID scripts&quot;. See extension &quot;whiteboard&quot; for an example!

2006-02-15  Michael Stucki  michael@typo3.org

    * Release of TYPO3 4.0beta3
    * Various changes to indexed_search, see local ChangeLog for details
    * Install Tool: Added &quot;cache_imagesizes&quot; to list of tables that can be cleared
    *&amp;nbsp;!!! Indexed Search: Removed all options for indexing OpenOffice.org/OpenDocument files and replaced them with the above &quot;unzip&quot; option. Affected options are: nativeOOMethod, OOoExtract, ruby
    *&amp;nbsp;!!! Indexed Search: Changed all default paths from /usr/local/bin/ to /usr/bin/
    * Removed create_symlink.sh and remove_symlink.sh from CVS because they are not needed anymore. If you still want to use symbolic links for some reason, you can find some good information in the &quot;TYPO3 Installation &amp; Upgrade&quot; manual.

2006-02-15  Karsten Dambekalns  karsten@typo3.org

    * typo3/mod/tools/em: More fixes and better error checking.
    * typo3/sysext/adodb: Update to upstream version 4.71.
    * t3lib/class.t3lib_tsfebeuserauth: The admin panel uses GET instead of POST now.

2006-02-15  Bernhard Kraft  kraftb@kraftb.at

    * Fixed an issue with the new GIFBUILDER code and transparentColor TS option. Also fixed some minor bugs with not unlinked temp files.

2006-02-15  Kasper Skaarhoj  kasperYYYY@typo3.com

    * Changed usage of showpic.php: Now, the reference to showpic.php from inside tslib_content is done using &quot;index.php?eID=tx_cms_showpic&amp;...&quot;+usual parameters. This is the future supported way of accessing the services of showpic! It also means that other scripts offering FE services bypassing tslib_fe can use same methodology! Applications I can think of: AJAX data, streams (like secure download scripts passing binary data through). This change means that &quot;showpic.php&quot; is not needed as a symlink anymore, neither as a script in the core root!

2006-02-15  Rene Fritz  r.fritz@colorcube.de

    * Added hook to element browser to make it possible to render own EB&#39;s. All EB classes are moved into an own file.
    * Added the possiblity to set TCEForm items to read-only.

2006-02-14  Karsten Dambekalns  karsten@typo3.org

    * typo3/mod/tools/em: Fixed/enhanced dependency checking in the new EM.

2006-02-14  Stanislas Rolland  stanislas.rolland@fructifor.ca

    * Changes to the htmlArea RTE extension (see details in local ChangeLog)

2006-02-14  Rene Fritz  r.fritz@colorcube.de

    * Moved t3lib/gfx/ to typo3/gfx/
    * Changed all references of t3lib/gfx/ to gfx/ or typo3/gfx/
    * Made some FE references to media/...
    * Added index.php, showpic.php and thumbs.php scripts
    * All thoese changes were made to make it possible to use the TYPO3 source without symlinks
    *&amp;nbsp;!!! As a consequence of this, the symlinks &quot;arial.ttf&quot; and &quot;verdana.ttf&quot; in t3lib/fonts/ have been removed completely. Please make sure that you have updated your TypoScript template accordingly. You can either upload the original fonts to the server or use a similar looking font instead (nimbus.ttf instead of arial.ttf, vera.ttf instead of verdana.ttf - both are located in t3lib/fonts/).

2006-02-14  Kasper Skaarhoj  kasperYYYY@typo3.com

    * Fixed part II of the versioning swapping change: Now versioning is completely independent of MySQL versions and it is fully DBAL compliant: Records are swapping content rather than ids (locking file support integrated which stores swapped records in case something goes wrong - however, no tool for reverting using this lock file...)
    * Finished version 1.0 of the ADMCMD_prev feature which allows a keyword (md5 hash) to preview pages which otherwise would require a backend login (like workspace preview). In WebVersioning you will find an implementation of this feature which will generate links you can sent to people for previewing workspace content. The concept could be extended to set other preview flags like hidden/starttime/endtime/fe_groups etc. But this is just a simple implementation for workspaces.

2006-02-14  Wolfgang Klinger  wk@plan2.net

    * Fixed bug #2507: Wrong where clause (&#39;1&#39; instead of &#39;1=1&#39;)
    * Fixed bug #2508: t3lib/class.t3lib_tcemain.php uses hardcoded quotes

2006-02-13  Rene Fritz  r.fritz@colorcube.de

    * Install tool PHP and HTML code cleanup towards xhtml

2006-02-13  Karsten Dambekalns  karsten@typo3.org

    * class.tx_install.php: Changed the way documentation is extracted from comments in config_default.php.
    * t3lib/config_default.php, typo3/stylesheet.css, typo3/mod/tools/em/: First CVS release of new Extension Manager codebase.

2006-02-11  Bernhard Kraft  kraftb@kraftb.at

    * Fixed bug #1270: Garbled characters in cshItems when forceCharset is set to utf-8

2006-02-11  Kasper Skaarhoj  kasperYYYY@typo3.com

    * Changed swapping mechanism for versioning. Still need to fix locking file integration.

2006-02-10  Stanislas Rolland  stanislas.rolland@fructifor.ca

    * Remove Direct Mail code from tslib_fe and add checkDataSubmission hook

2006-02-10  Christian Jul Jensen  christian@jul.net

    * Added TCAselectItem to stdWrap, see TSref

2006-02-09  Rene Fritz  r.fritz@colorcube.de

    * Added $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[&#39;SYS&#39;][&#39;binSetup&#39;] and made t3lib_exec use of it.
    * Added TSconfig option options.hideRecords.[table]. Used in pagetree nav frame, weblist module, new record wizard

2006-02-09  Sebastian Kurfuerst  sebastian@garbage-group.de

    * Fixed bug #2105: The width of tt_content is too large (due to access options)

2006-02-08  Stanislas Rolland  stanislas.rolland@fructifor.ca

    * Fixed bug #2365: Replace true linebreaks with space inside block tags and after hr tags in t3lib_parsehtml_proc.
    * Changes to the htmlArea RTE extension (see details in local ChangeLog)
    * Fixed bug #1496: Enable Direct Mail to fetch a server listening to a port other than 80 (t3lib_htmlmail)
    * Fix stdAuthCode in t3lib_div

2006-02-08  Michael Stucki  michael@typo3.org

    * Various changes to indexed_search, see local ChangeLog for details
    *&amp;nbsp;!!! Changed default value of TYPO3_CONF_VARS[BE][fileCreateMask/folderCreateMask]. By default, those files are no longer writable for the group.
    * Fixed bug #2272: Added [PAGE].includeJS plus possibility to attach .js files to template resources (thanks to Johannes Vockeroth)
    * Fixed bug #75: t3lib_extfilefunc::func_copy() does not set file permissions properly
    * Encode whitespaces in t3lib_div::encodeHeader() as required by RFC 2047 (thanks to Stanislas)
    * Added crdate and tstamp fields to be selected by users in the Web-List view
    * Fixed bug #2200: In FEediting the creation of new records in other pages than the current should be possible

2006-02-07  Ingmar Schlecht ingmar@typo3.org

    * Adjustments to the htmlArea RTE extension (see details in local ChangeLog)

2006-02-01  Dmitry Dulepov  typo3@accio.lv

2006-01-30  Michael Stucki  michael@typo3.org

    * Added two hooks to class.t3lib_tceforms.php, getMainFieldsClass: getMainFields_preProcess and getMainFields_postProcess (requested by Thomas Hempel for use with the &quot;dynaflex&quot; extension.
    * Fixed gremlin #1628: Removed &quot;Text with image below&quot; from the content wizard
    * Removed hardcoded maximum size of popup images

2006-01-29  Michael Stucki  michael@typo3.org

    * Added UTF8-support for emails. Thanks to Bernhard Kraft, Stanislas Rolland and Martin Kutschker for their feedback.
    * Changes in t3lib_div::plainMailEncoded(): By default, emails will be encoded to quoted-printable.
    * Email linebreaks are now &quot;\n&quot; except on Windows, where they are &quot;\r\n&quot;. Thanks to Stanislas and Martin for their feedback.
    * t3lib_formmail now encodes emails as quoted-printable. base64 needs to be enabled explicitely.
    * Install Tool now uses t3lib_div::plainMailEncoded() instead of mail() to send plain text mails.
    * Install Tool now displays warning messages using t3lib_div::debug() instead of debug() which does not work in all cases.
    * Marked t3lib_htmlmail-convertName() as deprecated because header lines are now encoded automatically.

2006-01-28  Martin Kutschker  martin.t.kutschker@blackbox.net

2006-01-27  Sebastian Kurfuerst  sebastian@garbage-group.de

    * Fixed bug #2337: remove 30KB editing limit in Template Editor
    * Fixed bug #2405: CSC - allow styles and additional table class
    * Fixed little removed reference operator in class.t3lib_tcemain.php line 1817 (triggers a call-time pass-by-reference warning) - eval API code

2006-01-27  Martin Kutschker  martin.t.kutschker@blackbox.net

    * added error logging to DB initialization code
    * improved FQDN detection and fixed empty syslog ident in t3lib_div::initSysLog()
    * Fix problem with non-associative arrays in t3lib_db-fullQuoteArray()

2006-01-27  Peter Niederlag  peter@niederlag.de

    * Fixed bug #2023, removed most of RTE-Config from sysEXT:cms and sysExt:css-styled_content

2006-01-27  Ingmar Schlecht  ingmar@typo3.org

    * Added label tags around &quot;Expand all&quot; in class.alt_menu_functions.inc

2006-01-27  Kasper Skaarhoj  kasperYYYY@typo3.com

    * Improved output of FlexForm contents inside of eg. WebList module (stripping tags that is&amp;nbsp;:-)
    * Added function for counting references to records (in t3lib_BEfunc)
    * Added warning to About Modules if the reference index is empty (which it will be for all updates to 4.0)
    * Added connectDB function in t3lib_db (used by clients of new feature in index_ts.php, see later.)
    * Fixed bug in t3lib_install which resulted in no recognition of the install tool token in localconf.php files: Essentially this has lead to bloated localconf.php files on windows machines if they were edited manually with chr(13).chr(10) line endings.
    * Added &quot;deleted&quot; column to reference index.
    * Working on cli-script for updating reference index from command line (necessary for large databases!!)
    * Added new class, t3lib_flexformtools, providing framework for manipulation of flexform data. (specifically it can be used for traversal of flexform data).
    * Fixed a bug related to language-limiting: Now, a backend user limited to a certain language cannot create records in default or other languages anymore.
    * Fixed bug in t3lib_tcemain where files uploaded to a record in case of auto-versioning did not work
    * Fixed very tricky problem that an auto-versioned record with files attached would create double-references! Uh.... Look for -autoVersioningUpdate in tcemain and there is a fine explanation of a scenario and how I worked around it.
    *&amp;nbsp;!!! Changed the XML markup for flexform output. Now some more reasonable tags are used. If t3lib_div xml2array + array2xml functions are used, fully backwards compatible. Extensions which depend on the old tag names will break. Use t3lib_flexformtools for writing XML output for flexforms in the future!
    * Improved length of sys_refindex.ref_string from 40 to 200 chars.
    * Added information about number of references pointing to record or file before its deleted (didn&#39;t localize the message though)
    * Added reference count column to WebList and FileFilelist modules plus overview table in the Info display for files and records (ah, finally there is a reason for that fine info-screen...)
    * Set a security precaution in ws/workspaceforms.php (Dmitry should take a look and learn&amp;nbsp;:-)
    * Added feature in index_ts.php allowing faster dynamic websites and AJAX implementations in particular. The idea is that extensions can register a keyword which triggers inclusion of another PHP file quite early in index_ts.php. Only basic libraries and configuration is included, then branched of. From that point its up to the third-party script whether it should connect to database, initialize FE users etc, all depending on their need and allowed overhead. The keyword is registered in $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[&#39;FE&#39;][&#39;eID_include&#39;][_keyword_] and calling index.php?eID=_keyword_ will trigger the inclusion. I will publish a new extension, &quot;whiteboard&quot;, demonstrating a sample implementation using simple AJAX stuff.
    * Began working on a preview-facility which will allow for preview of eg. a workspace page without a backend login.
    * Started a cleaner-module in WebFunction (coming from the &quot;lowlevel&quot; system extension). The cleaner consists of analysis tools and clean-up tools (based on the analysis), all working with the sys_refindex table as well. Eventually it will allow for nightly, cron-job based checks of the system including a report email to administrator. This way, data and link integrity and log reports can be reviewed each day.

2006-01-27  Christian Jul Jensen  christian@jul.net

    * Minor bugfix in sys_actions related to the taskcenter changes in 3.8
    * Added manual sorting of sys_actions records

    * Fix issue #2358.

2006-01-26  Michael Stucki  michael@typo3.org

    * Fixed bug #1625: Pages with &quot;hide in menu&quot; flag have got the same pagetree icon like not-in-menu pages.
    * Changed $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[GFX][im_version_5] into a string. Possible values are &quot;im4&quot;, &quot;im5&quot;, &quot;im6&quot; or &quot;gm&quot;. Boolean values will still work where &quot;0&quot; means &quot;im4&quot; and &quot;1&quot; means &quot;im5&quot;.
    *&amp;nbsp;!!! Renamed the hooks $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[SC_OPTIONS][tslib/class.tslib_feuserauth.php][logoff_pre_processing] + $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[SC_OPTIONS][tslib/class.tslib_feuserauth.php][logoff_post_processing] and replaced &quot;tslib/class.tslib_feuserauth.php&quot; with &quot;t3lib/class.t3lib_userauth.php&quot; (which is the correct place for this hook).

2006-01-26  Dmitry Dulepov  typo3@accio.lv

    * Fixed bug #1947: &quot;Page is being generated&quot; is bad for search engines

2006-01-24  Stanislas Rolland  stanislas.rolland@fructifor.ca

    * t3lib_htmlmail: Correct encoding of jumper url
    * t3lib_htmlmail: Avoid applying illegal encoding domain to multipart headers (when html has media)

2006-01-22  Ingmar Schlecht  ingmar@typo3.org

    * Fixed bug: The nav frame do not update properly when submodules register different nav frames with navFrameScript in MCONF. (class.alt_menu_functions.php)
    * Fixed bug: fixed bug related to PHP5 and clone() in tslib_content
    * Fixed issue: Added clone() compatibility function for PHP4
    * Fixed bug: The javascript dyn tabs used for eg. TCEForms and placed in template.php were not shown when used in popup windows because of an uninitialized variable.
    * Fixed a missing &quot;global&quot;: added a missing global $TYPO3_CONF_VARS; to t3lib_userauthgroup::fetchGroups which would have been prevented that the hook fetchGroupQuery worked
