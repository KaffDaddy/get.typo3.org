Upgrading
---------

1.  Before you update any instance to 7.6, have a backup in place.
2.  Then uninstall any extension, that is not shipped with the core.
    This will avoid broken backend after upgrade due to removed class
    alias layer.
3.  Now download the new core and present it to your instance (by
    symlink or copied files)
4.  Use the install tool to run the upgrade wizards
5.  Use the install tool to clear each and every cache you can find,
    even opcode.
6.  Open the backend and go to the extensionmanager. When you use an
    extension that uses core classes without namespaces, activate the
    compatibility6 extension which can be found in the TYPO3 Extension
    Repository of typo3.org. You find further information about this
    extension and its purpose at
    <https://typo3.org/news/article/retaining-compatibility-to-typo3-cms-6/>
7.  Now reactivate your extensions and enjoy the brand new TYPO3 CMS 7.
8.  When you encounter compatibility problems with your extensions, look
    for the git versions around in order to find one already upgraded.
