            <p>
                TYPO3 Release Packages (the downloadable tarballs and zip files) as well as Git tags are signed
                using PGP signatures during the automated release process. Besides that, MD5 and SHA2-256 hashes are
                being generated for these files. Find more details on verifying signatures and hashes in the
                <a href="https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/drafts/github/TYPO3Incubator/InfrastructureGuide/Releases/">infrastructure
                    guide</a>.
